Phosphor: Dynamic Taint Tracking for the JVM
========


Phosphor is a system for performing dynamic taint analysis in the JVM, on commodity JVMs (e.g. Oracle's HotSpot or OpenJDK's IcedTea). This repository contains the source for Phosphor. For more information about how Phosphor works and what it could be useful for, please refer to our [Technical Report](https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1569) or email [Jonathan Bell](mailto:jbell@cs.columbia.edu).
